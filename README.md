Hello, my name is Maximilian Fischer. I'm a Mobile Developer with focus on iOS ðŸ“±. I've been developing mobile apps for 10 years now and have gained extensive knowledge in the field.

I love to develop new apps, both from scratch or by tweaking existing ones. My favorite part of development is when an idea becomes reality!

Collaborating with me will be a breeze. Simply visit my website www.route242.com or message me on Twitter [@_ROUTE242](http://twitter.com/_route242) to get in touch!
